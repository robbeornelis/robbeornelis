## Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I am a student at Artevelde Hogeschool Gent (graduate degree) and I'm mostly interested in front-end development but I'm also interested in back-end development.

I'm fluent in dutch and english (and I also understand basic french).

I'm alright with HTML, CSS and Javascript but I still have lots to learn about those languages.
